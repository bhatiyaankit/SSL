<h3>DIRECTOR'S MEASSAGE</h3>
<P>It is well known that sports have a positive influence on the personal and moral development of youth. Being a positive alternative in the daily lives of students, sports serve as recreation which develops self-esteem, self-discipline and responsibility among the students. Sports assume a higher level of importance today than earlier times in view of the complex environment, competitive and stressful condition, children and youth are facing today.<br>

Over the last few decades the Inter IIT sports meet has been transforming into a mega extravaganza with rising number of students and staff contingents with the present number stands at 23 IITs participating in the event. Such a grand meet helps in creating a positive and competitive environment within a campus throughout the year among the students.<br>

I am delighted to notice that the new IITs are giving tough competition to the older IITs at the events. This is indeed a good progress which will help in maintaining high standards at the competitions.<br>

I am glad that the 54th Inter-IIT Sports Meet is scheduled to be organised with enhanced vigour and enthusiasm, from Dec 14th -22nd, 2019 at IIT Kharagpur as well as at IIT Bhubaneswar. It is for the first time in the history of the Inter IIT, a new generation IIT is co-hosting the event along with a senior IIT. I hope that this Sports Meet will bring the students, faculty members and staff of all IITs together for upholding the sportsman spirit and betterment of the society.</P>

<p>I wish good luck to all the participating teams. Finally I wish the events at IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bhubaneswar, a grand success.
</p>

<p>With best wishes,<br>
    
Prof R. V. Raja Kumar<br>
Director, IIT Bhubaneswar</p>
